# Developer Insights
1. Crafted App keeping in mind the use case of single API call.
2. Didn't incorporated other API methods and their logic e.g. POST, PUT, DELETE. Since the app was intented to use only GET API call therefore, quite a few things were omitted.
3. Not using activity indicator as well as any failure case dialogues for my own time saving.
4. Didn't incorporated Unit & UITests because it was mentioned by the interviewer that you normally don't use this approach.

# Took more than 5 hours to complete the task. Couldn't work consecutively because of my busy routine.
